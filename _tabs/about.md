{: .prompt-tip }
I am a computer engineering student with around 1.5 years of experience as a software engineer, specializing in backend development using Django and Django Rest Framework. My coursework has provided me with a strong foundation in computer science and engineering concepts, including programming languages, algorithms, data structures, and computer systems.

In addition to my formal education, I have gained hands-on experience through various projects and internships. Some of the technologies I have worked with include:

- C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, and other programming languages
- Backend development using Django and Django Rest Framework
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) and PyTorch

I am always eager to learn and explore new technologies, and I am excited to continue growing as a computer engineer. If you have any questions or opportunities, feel free to reach out.
