# Vim




## About Vim

- Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind
 of text very efficient
- an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems
- Vim is a modal editor: it has different modes for inserting text vs manipulating text
- Vim is programmable (with Vimscript and also other languages like Python)
- Vim avoids the use of the mouse, because it‚Äôs too slow
- Vim even avoids using the arrow keys because it requires too much movement

## Modal Editing

Vim has multiple operating modes

- Normal: for moving around a file and making edits
- Insert: for inserting text
- Replace: for replacing text
- Visual (plain, line, or block): for selecting blocks of text
- Command-line: for running a command

<aside>
üì¢ **Keystorkes have different meaning in different operating modes**

</aside>

## changing modes

for default case followings keys are used

- <Esc>  Normal Mode
- i   Insert mode
- v  visual mode
- R replace mode
- V visual line mode
- :   command line mode

## Buffer tabs and windows

- buffer is set of open files
- Unlike other programs you are familiar with, like web browsers, there is not a 1-to-1 correspondence between buffers and windows
- A given buffer may be open in multiple windows, even within the same tab which can be
handy to view two different parts of file at same time

## Command mode

This mode  has many functionalities, including opening, saving, and closing files, and quitting Vim.

- **:q** quit (close window)
- **:w** save (‚Äúwrite‚Äù)
- **:wq** save and quit
- **:e** {name of file} open file for editing
- **:ls** show open buffers
- **:help {topic}** open help
    - **:help :w** opens help for the :w command
    - **:help w** opens help for the w movement
